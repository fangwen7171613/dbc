# DBC - Database Read-Write Separation Framework

**DBC** is a component of the Software Development Platform (SDP), tailored to enhance database performance in high transactional environments through efficient read-write separation.

## Overview

The DBC framework is specialized in managing high read-write ratios, distributing database loads, and ensuring optimal performance across clustered environments. Its design allows for seamless scalability, providing a robust solution for systems that require high-availability and fault-tolerant database operations.

## Features

- **Read-Write Separation**: Maximizes efficiency by distributing read and write operations across different database instances.
- **Cluster Load Balancing**: Implements advanced algorithms to balance the load dynamically across the cluster, ensuring no single node becomes a bottleneck.
- **Scalable Performance**: Designed to scale horizontally, DBC can handle an increasing workload by simply adding more nodes to the cluster without a theoretical performance cap.

## Getting Started

To integrate DBC into your projects, begin with cloning the SDP repository and navigating to the DBC module:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fangwen7171613/sdp.git
cd sdp/src/dbc
# Follow the setup and installation instructions detailed in the SDP documentation
